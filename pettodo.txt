predict draw when folding pre-draw

pgi - play cbet freq
pgi - times float, fold to float
pgi - steal, fold to steal
ditch am/hand

hud:
font +/-
no more for this table (zoom) - test
table mean/median/sd
hud historial hands/vpip etc
equity - should say unknown for streets with no action

draw - populate blockers from last hand
all eq panels - use blockers, hide with cb

hands - remove some columns by default, e.g. board, last flop

replay - doesn't scoop bets together before collect


history - restrict by date/size/no of hands, **today only
**dont throw exception on unparsable hand
memory usage on history page
windows ps directory
**ignore play


**limit window size

fix slow scrolling in eq panels
add subtabs/about
doesnt give error if follow dir doesn't exist
needs icon
file open dialog isn't modal
warn if follow dir is empty
<> syms don't display on linux
external border for fields

eq isn't 100% if folding without showdown... breaks ev

display total ev in hud
display total ev in graph...


amounts in bb
spr should be for first act only
hud should say if eq is est
rep/hands send to eq button

keyboard entry of hands, dragging of cards

hands - day session/graph

draw prefers inside 9-high gutter to 8/7 high oesd

draw panel: add a-5, 2-7 low, hilo opt?
